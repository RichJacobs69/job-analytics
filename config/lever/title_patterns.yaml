# Lever Job Title Filter Patterns
# =======================================
# Purpose: Identify relevant Data, Product, and Delivery roles before LLM classification
# Source: Copied from greenhouse_title_patterns.yaml - same patterns work for Lever
# Impact: Reduces classification costs by 60-70% by filtering out Sales, Marketing, HR, etc.
#
# Pattern Syntax:
# - Case-insensitive matching
# - Standard regex syntax (| for OR, .* for wildcards, \s for whitespace)
# - Patterns applied with word boundaries for accuracy

# Core title patterns for Data and Product families
