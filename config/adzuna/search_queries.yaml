# Adzuna Search Queries Configuration
# ====================================
# Purpose: Define job search queries for Adzuna API
# Unlike Greenhouse/Lever (which use regex patterns for filtering),
# Adzuna uses these as direct API search terms.
#
# Note: Adzuna API searches are keyword-based, not regex.
# Each query is sent as-is to the Adzuna search endpoint.
