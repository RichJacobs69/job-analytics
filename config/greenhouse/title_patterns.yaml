# Greenhouse Job Title Filter Patterns
# =======================================
# Purpose: Identify relevant Data and Product roles before LLM classification
# Impact: Reduces classification costs by 60-70% by filtering out Sales, Marketing, HR, Finance, Legal, etc.
#
# Experiment Results (2025-11-26):
# - Tested on Stripe (100+ jobs)
# - Match rate: ~30-40% (aggressive filtering)
# - False negatives: <5% (minimal relevant jobs filtered out)
# - Cost savings: 60-70% reduction in classification costs
#
# Pattern Syntax:
# - Case-insensitive matching
# - Standard regex syntax (| for OR, .* for wildcards, \s for whitespace)
# - Patterns applied with word boundaries for accuracy

# Core title patterns for Data and Product families

  Edge Cases Covered:
  - Seniority prefixes: "Senior", "Staff", "Principal", "Lead" automatically matched
  - Analytics variations: "Analytics Engineer", "Analytics Lead", "Analytics Manager"
  - Applied roles: "Applied Scientist", "Applied ML"
  - Combined titles: "AI Product Manager", "Data Product Manager", "ML PM"

  Known Good Matches (from validation):
  - "Analytics Lead" [OK]
  - "Principal Data Scientist" [OK]
  - "Staff Data PM" [OK]
  - "Senior ML Engineer" [OK]
  - "Applied Research Scientist" [OK]
  - "Data Platform Engineer" [OK]
  - "Senior Data Science Manager" [OK] (added 2025-12-22)
  - "Data Engineering Manager" [OK] (added 2025-12-22)
  - "ML Manager" [OK] (added 2025-12-22)
  - "Associate Director, Analytics" [OK] (added 2025-12-23)

  - "Head of Data Science" [OK] (added 2025-12-23)
  - "Chief Data Officer" [OK] (added 2025-12-23)

  Known Filtered Roles (expected to NOT match):
  - "Account Executive" [NOT OK]
  - "Sales Development Representative" [NOT OK]

  - "DevOps Engineer" [NOT OK]
  - "HR Business Partner" [NOT OK]
  - "Legal Counsel" [NOT OK]
  - "Finance Analyst" [NOT OK] (not data analyst)

  Ambiguous Cases (intentionally excluded):
  - "Software Engineer" - Too broad, would catch backend/frontend/infra roles
  - "Engineer" alone - Way too broad
  - "Analyst" alone - Could be Financial Analyst, Business Analyst (non-data)
  - "Product Marketing" - Marketing role, not core PM
  - "Growth Engineer" - Engineering role, not product/data focus
