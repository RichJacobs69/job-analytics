# MAINTENANCE GUIDELINES
# =========================

maintenance:
  how_to_add_agencies:
    - "Run: SELECT employer_name, COUNT(*) FROM raw_jobs GROUP BY employer_name ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 100"
    - "Manually review top employers"
    - "Add confirmed agencies to hard_filter list"
    - "Update last_updated date"
    - "Increment version if major changes"
  
  review_frequency: "Monthly - check for new high-volume agencies"
  
  false_positive_monitoring: "If is_agency=true but user reports legitimate job, add to legitimate_companies"

# =========================
# STATISTICS TRACKING
# =========================
# Track impact of filtering over time

expected_metrics:
  hard_filter_rate: "10-15% of raw jobs skipped"
  soft_flag_rate: "5-10% of remaining jobs flagged as potential agencies"
  false_positive_rate: "Target <5% of flagged jobs are actually direct employers"
  cost_savings: "~$0.04 per 10 filtered jobs (assuming $0.004/job classification)"
