While everything at Paytm is intelligent already, “Paytm Intelligence” to us is our effort to make computers intelligent enough to do more than what we know today. We have found that more and more of the decisions we take in our company are delegated to computers leading to lesser errors and a clear competitive advantage.\n \nOver the past few years, we have continuously automated and improved our systems tech to get every inch of improved user experience and efficiency in how we serve our merchants and users. At the scale of Paytm, this has been an amazing opportunity to work on problems at a massive scale and also stay dependable, secure and compliant. The skills, technology and the people we have built to achieve this has been a unique advantage. \n\nTo get there, we have built a few key components like our own AI Agentic Platform (an engine that powers our internal workflows), foundation model for payments and credit, a voice-based conversation stack, and a highly optimized DIY feature engineering stack to name a few things. \n\nIt all comes together in building a suite of solutions for enterprises and small businesses that will give them killer products to help them grow. We feel our QR code, soundbox and real-time settlements were a game-changer for the merchants who did not have access to anything like that before. And now, with the agentic products that are in our pipeline, we hope to do the same for the next generation of merchants and users.\n\nThis is a call for people who believe in the mission above.
