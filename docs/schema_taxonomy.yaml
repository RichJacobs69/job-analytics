# Job Market Intelligence Platform - Taxonomy Schema
# Version: 1.3.1
# Last Updated: 2025-11-14
# Purpose: Define classification taxonomy for job postings in Product and Data roles
# Changes from v1.3: Added descriptions to all enums for better LLM classification

metadata:
  version: 1.3.1
  last_updated: "2025-11-14"
  scope: ["Product", "Data"]
  markets: ["London", "New York", "Denver"]
  extraction_complexity:
    simple: [employer.name, role.title_display, location.city_code, posting.posted_date]
    moderate: [job_subfamily, skills.items.name, working_arrangement, position_type, seniority]
    complex: [experience_range, compensation.base_salary_range]
  data_availability:
    always: [title, company, location, url, posted_date]  # >95%
    usually: [skills, job_type, arrangement, department, seniority]  # 70-90%
    sometimes: [salary, experience_years]  # 30-50%
    rarely: [equity, headcount]  # <10%

# =========================
# FIELD DEFINITIONS (Output Schema)
# =========================
# These define the structured output after LLM classification
# LLM should return JSON matching this exact structure

# CLASSIFICATION GUIDANCE

# Critical rules for LLM classifier - read carefully before classifying

classification_guidance:
  agency_detection:
    high_confidence_indicators:
      - "Employer name contains: 'Recruitment', 'Recruiting', 'Talent', 'Staffing', 'Search', 'Headhunters', 'Solutions', 'Consulting', 'Partners', 'Associates'"
      - "Job description says: 'our client', 'on behalf of', 'exciting opportunity', 'leading company', 'confidential client'"
      - "Employer is known agency: Hays, Robert Half, Michael Page, Randstad, Adecco, Manpower, Harvey Nash"
    
    medium_confidence_indicators:
      - "Generic job description with minimal company details"
      - "Employer name ends with: Ltd, Limited, Group, International, Global (combined with recruitment terms)"
      - "CV submission instructions rather than application process"
    
    false_positives_to_avoid:
      - "Accenture Consulting, McKinsey - these are NOT recruitment agencies"
      - "Companies with 'Solutions' or 'Partners' in name are often legitimate tech companies"
      - "When in doubt, default to is_agency=false"

  seniority:
    priority_order:
      - "**Title is primary signal**: If title explicitly states level (Junior, Senior, Staff, Principal, Director), use that as primary classification"
      - "**Years as secondary signal**: Use experience years only when title is ambiguous (e.g., 'Data Scientist' without level qualifier)"
      - "**When both present**: If title and years conflict, prioritize title unless conflict is extreme (e.g., 'Junior' with 15 years)"
    
    year_boundary_rules:
      - "2 years exactly → junior (not mid)"
      - "3 years exactly → mid (not junior)"
      - "5 years exactly → mid (not senior)"
      - "6 years exactly → senior (not mid)"
      - "10 years exactly → senior (not staff_principal)"
      - "11 years exactly → staff_principal (not senior)"
      - "When years are borderline (e.g., '5-7 years'), use title as tiebreaker"
    
    title_priority_examples:
      - "'Senior Data Scientist, 4 years' → senior (title wins over years)"
      - "'Staff Engineer, 8 years' → staff_principal (title wins)"
      - "'Director of Data, 7 years' → director_plus (title wins)"
      - "'Data Scientist, 7 years' → senior (years guide when no level in title)"
      - "'Lead Data Scientist' → senior (Lead = senior level)"
      - "'Principal PM, 9 years' → staff_principal (title wins despite years suggesting senior)"
    
    market_context:
      - "UK Senior roles typically 6-8 years; US Senior roles typically 7-10 years"
      - "Both map to 'senior' classification for cross-market comparison"
      - "'Staff' and 'Principal' titles → staff_principal regardless of years stated"
      - "'Architect' roles → senior unless combined with 'Principal/Staff' (then staff_principal) or very senior (11+ years)"
    
    track_distinction:
      - "staff_principal = IC track (Staff Engineer, Principal PM, Distinguished Scientist)"
      - "director_plus = Management track (Director, VP, Head of, C-level)"
      - "These are parallel paths, not sequential - don't promote Staff to Director"
      - "Director with 8 years → director_plus (management track, ignore years)"
    
    edge_cases:
      - "Lead Engineer without years → senior (Lead = senior IC, not management)"
      - "Principal Engineer without years → staff_principal"
      - "Engineering Manager without years → senior (entry-level management)"
      - "Director without years → director_plus (management hierarchy)"
      - "Senior Engineer, 12+ years → senior (title wins, don't auto-promote to staff_principal)"
      - "'Architect' alone with 6-8 years → senior"
      - "'Principal Architect' → staff_principal"
      - "'5+ years' requirement → Use title to determine level (senior if title is Senior, mid if title is generic)"
    
    default_when_ambiguous: "mid"

  job_subfamily:
    key_distinctions:
      - "Product Analytics vs Data Analyst: Product Analytics = product metrics, user behavior, in-product experimentation, feature analysis, growth analytics. Data Analyst = business reporting, dashboards, ad-hoc SQL analysis, BI tools."
      - "Analytics Engineer vs Data Engineer: Analytics Engineer = dbt, metrics layer, SQL-focused, data modeling, semantic layer. Data Engineer = pipelines, infrastructure, Python/Scala-focused, ETL/ELT, big data."
      - "ML Engineer scope (EXPANDED): Includes both classical ML (training models, feature engineering) AND GenAI/LLM work (fine-tuning, embeddings, RAG systems, agent frameworks) when focused on MODEL DEVELOPMENT. If role is primarily calling LLM APIs with minimal ML work, classify as out_of_scope (Software Engineering)."
      - "Data Scientist vs Research Scientist: Data Scientist = business insights, predictions, practical ML, stakeholder communication. Research Scientist = novel research, publications, cutting-edge techniques, pushing SOTA."
      - "Technical PM vs Platform PM: Technical PM = deep technical skills, often ex-engineer, technical architecture. Platform PM = developer tools, APIs, infrastructure products (may or may not be technical)."
    
    product_analytics_routing:
      - "Title 'Product Analyst' → Check job description:"
      - "  - If mentions: product metrics, user behavior, experimentation, A/B tests, feature analysis, growth → product_analytics"
      - "  - If mentions: business reporting, dashboards, SQL queries, BI tools, stakeholder reports → data_analyst"
      - "Title 'Product Analytics' → Always product_analytics"
      - "Title 'Growth Analyst' → Usually product_analytics (growth is product-adjacent)"
    
    ml_engineer_vs_software_engineer:
      - "AI Engineer title → Classify as out_of_scope UNLESS description clearly involves:"
      - "  - Training/fine-tuning ML models"
      - "  - Building ML pipelines or MLOps infrastructure"
      - "  - Research on model architectures"
      - "  - Feature engineering or data science workflows"
      - "If AI Engineer role is primarily: API integration, prompt engineering without model work, backend development → out_of_scope"
      - "If ML Engineer role involves LLMs, RAG, embeddings, fine-tuning → ml_engineer (legitimate ML work)"

  working_arrangement:
    classification_rules:
      - "If posting says 'remote OR hybrid OR onsite' → flexible"
      - "If posting says 'hybrid (2 days office)' → hybrid"

# =========================
# DEDUPLICATION STRATEGY
# =========================
# Used in data pipeline to identify duplicate postings

deduplication:
  hash_fields: [employer.name, role.title_display, location.city_code]
  similarity_threshold: 0.85  # For fuzzy matching of descriptions
  time_window_days: 30  # Consider same job if posted within this window
  notes: "Jobs are considered duplicates if they have matching company, title, and location within 30-day window"
