# New York Data & Analytics Market
## December 2025

---

## Key Findings

New York's data and analytics market in December 2025 reveals a pronounced shift toward machine learning and artificial intelligence roles, with ML Engineering and Research Scientist positions together comprising 28% of all openings. This represents a significant transformation from traditional analytics-focused hiring patterns, suggesting that organizations across the city are investing heavily in AI infrastructure and capabilities. The concentration of ML roles is particularly notable given the diversity of industries represented, from financial services to consumer technology.

The market presents significant barriers to entry for early-career professionals. With a senior-to-junior ratio exceeding 10:1, employers are clearly prioritizing experienced talent capable of delivering immediate impact. Only 19% of roles are accessible to candidates with less than three years of experience, making New York one of the more challenging markets for new data professionals to break into. However, Data Analyst positions remain the most accessible entry point, with a median salary of $113K offering a solid foundation for career growth.

Established companies dominate hiring activity, with 52% of roles at organizations more than 15 years old. This reflects both the concentration of large financial institutions in the city and a broader trend toward stability-focused hiring in the current economic environment. Remote work remains notably scarce at just 6%, though hybrid arrangements (18%) provide some flexibility for candidates seeking work-life balance.

1.1. **ML/AI dominance:** ML Engineer (24%) and Research Scientist ML (4%) together account for 28% of all roles, signaling the ongoing transformation toward AI-first organizations
1.2. **Extreme seniority concentration:** 66% of roles require Senior+ experience with a 10:1 senior-to-junior ratio, making entry-level positioning exceptionally competitive
1.3. **Premium compensation for ML talent:** Research Scientists (ML) command $220K median salary while ML Engineers earn $178K, reflecting intense competition for specialized skills
1.4. **Finance sector leadership:** Financial services (7%) and fintech (4%) combined represent 11% of industry-tagged roles, with Capital One and JPMorgan accounting for 10% of the market
1.5. **Limited flexibility:** Remote work represents only 6% of roles, while hybrid (18%) offers the most realistic path to workplace flexibility

*Based on over 1,800 direct employer postings from 850+ companies. Recruitment agency listings excluded.*

## Key Takeaways: Job Seekers

2.1. **Target ML Engineering roles for maximum opportunity** - Nearly 1 in 4 openings are ML Engineer positions with a median salary of $178K. While Research Scientist ML pays even more ($220K median), these roles are fewer and require specialized research backgrounds. For candidates with strong Python and machine learning foundations, ML Engineering offers the best combination of volume and compensation.

2.2. **Finance and fintech dominate the landscape** - Financial services (7%) and fintech (4%) are the top hiring industries, with Capital One and JPMorgan combined accounting for 10% of the entire market. Candidates should tailor applications to demonstrate understanding of financial data challenges, regulatory requirements, and risk-related analytics.

2.3. **Mature companies offer stability but growth-stage offers upside** - 52% of jobs with company data are at mature companies (>15 years old), offering structured career paths, established teams, and predictable compensation. However, growth-stage companies (38%) provide equity upside and faster advancement for those willing to accept more risk.

2.4. **Remote is scarce, but hybrid is your best bet for flexibility** - The effective remote rate is only 6%, making fully remote positions highly competitive. Hybrid arrangements (18%) represent the most realistic option for candidates seeking workplace flexibility while remaining in the NYC market.

2.5. **Data Analyst remains the most accessible entry point** - At $113K median salary, Data Analyst is the most accessible subfamily for early-career professionals. While ML Engineer ($178K) pays 58% more, the 10:1 senior-to-junior ratio means competition for those roles is fierce. Building a foundation in analytics before transitioning to ML is a viable career strategy.

## Key Takeaways: Hiring Managers

3.1. **You are competing with finance giants for talent** - Capital One and JPMorgan combined represent 10% of the market, with deep pockets and strong brand recognition. Smaller organizations must differentiate on mission, culture, technology stack, or workplace flexibility to attract top candidates away from these established players.

3.2. **Private companies have a slight edge in hiring volume** - Private companies (13%) slightly outpace public companies (11%) in data hiring. However, private company candidates will expect equity compensation as part of their package, so be prepared to explain equity structures and potential valuations clearly.

3.3. **Research Scientists command premium compensation** - Research Scientist ML roles require $220K median salary to compete. Organizations seeking to build internal AI research capabilities must budget accordingly and be prepared to offer competitive total compensation packages including equity and research freedom.

3.4. **Enterprise companies dominate but startups can compete** - 25% of jobs are at enterprise companies (1,000+ employees) versus 11% at startups. Smaller organizations can compete by emphasizing equity upside, faster career progression, direct impact visibility, and cutting-edge technology exposure that larger companies may not offer.
