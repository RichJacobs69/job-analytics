# Denver Data & Analytics Market
## December 2025

## Key Findings

Denver stands apart from coastal tech hubs as an enterprise-dominated market built on data infrastructure. With 76% of positions at mature companies (over 15 years old) and 34% at enterprise-scale organizations, Denver offers a fundamentally different career proposition than San Francisco or New York. The market is anchored by established players like Oracle, Teradata, and Lockheed Martin, creating an environment where stability and structured career progression take precedence over startup equity and rapid growth trajectories.

What makes Denver particularly noteworthy for data professionals is its accessibility. The 6:1 senior-to-junior ratio represents the most welcoming entry point among major US markets - dramatically more accessible than New York's 10:1 or San Francisco's prohibitive 18:1. Combined with Colorado's nation-leading remote work adoption (37% of the workforce works remotely) and a 17% effective remote rate in data roles, Denver presents a compelling case for professionals seeking career stability with geographic flexibility. The cost-of-living advantage further strengthens this value proposition: a $137K median salary stretches considerably further in Denver than comparable salaries in coastal metros.

1.1. **Enterprise-dominated market:** 34% of all jobs are at enterprise companies (1,000+ employees), while 76% are at mature companies over 15 years old - the highest concentration of established employers among US data markets.
1.2. **Data infrastructure hub:** Data Infrastructure leads all industries at 13% of roles, reflecting Denver's position as home to Oracle, Teradata, and other enterprise data platform companies.
1.3. **Most accessible entry-level market:** The 6:1 senior-to-junior ratio is significantly more favorable than NYC (10:1) or SF (18:1), making Denver the best US market for early-career data professionals.
1.4. **Remote-friendly culture:** 17% effective remote rate - the highest among US markets analyzed - aligns with Colorado leading the nation in remote work adoption.
1.5. **Stability over equity:** Public companies (17%) significantly outnumber private companies (11%), suggesting candidates prioritize salary stability over equity upside.

*Based on over 650 direct employer postings from 300+ companies. Recruitment agency listings excluded.*

## Key Takeaways: Job Seekers

2.1. **Best entry-level odds in the US** - The 6:1 senior-to-junior ratio makes Denver the most accessible major US market for early-career data professionals. Compared to NYC's 10:1 and SF's prohibitive 18:1, Denver offers meaningfully better odds of landing your first or second data role. If you're breaking into the field, Denver deserves serious consideration.

2.2. **Data infrastructure companies dominate** - 13% of all jobs are at data infrastructure companies, with Oracle alone representing 6% of the market. If you have experience with enterprise data platforms, databases, or data warehousing, Denver's market is particularly well-suited to your skills.

2.3. **Mature companies mean structured career paths** - With 76% of jobs at companies over 15 years old, expect well-defined levels, established promotion criteria, and predictable progression. This is a market for building long-term careers rather than chasing hypergrowth.

2.4. **Remote work is genuinely available** - The 17% effective remote rate is the highest among US markets analyzed, and Colorado leads the nation with 37% of its workforce working remotely. Flexibility isn't just a perk here - it's a cultural expectation.

2.5. **Your salary goes further** - The $137K median is 23% lower than SF's $177K, but Denver's cost of living is 20-25% lower. Your effective purchasing power is competitive with coastal cities while enjoying a significantly lower stress environment.

## Key Takeaways: Hiring Managers

3.1. **Oracle dominates the competitive landscape** - At 6% of all market postings, Oracle is the single largest employer in Denver's data market. Any company hiring data professionals will compete against Oracle's brand recognition, compensation packages, and stability. Differentiation is essential.

3.2. **Public company candidates expect stability** - With 17% public company hiring versus only 11% private, Denver's talent pool is accustomed to stability-focused compensation. Emphasizing equity upside may be less compelling here than in SF or NYC; competitive base salaries and benefits matter more.

3.3. **Remote flexibility is a baseline expectation** - Colorado's remote work culture (37% of workforce) means candidates expect meaningful flexibility. Companies requiring full-time onsite presence will face a significant competitive disadvantage in attracting top talent.

3.4. **Enterprise talent is available but expects structure** - The 76% mature company concentration means experienced candidates are available, but they may expect clear org charts, defined processes, and predictable environments. Startups will need to sell their specific value proposition carefully.

## Industry Distribution

**Based on 350 jobs, 52% coverage**

| Industry | % of Roles |
|----------|------------|
| Data Infrastructure | 13% |
| Professional Services | 10% |
| AI & Machine Learning | 6% |
| Consumer Tech | 4% |
| E-commerce & Retail | 4% |
| Healthcare & Biotech | 3% |
| Other | 3% |
| Financial Services | 2% |
| Cybersecurity | 2% |
| Property Technology | 2% |

*Chart: Horizontal bar*

**Interpretation:** Denver's data market is distinctly different from coastal cities and tells a story of enterprise data infrastructure dominance. Data Infrastructure (13%) leads all industries by a significant margin, reflecting the presence of Oracle, Teradata, and other enterprise data platform companies that have established major operations in the Denver metro area. Professional Services (10%) represents the second-largest category, driven by consulting firms like Deloitte that serve the enterprise customer base. Notably, AI & Machine Learning (6%) is present but not dominant as it is in San Francisco (15%) - Denver's market is built on data foundations rather than cutting-edge ML research.

---

## Company Maturity

**Based on founding_year (205 jobs, 30% coverage)**

| Maturity | % of Roles |
|----------|------------|
| Young (<=5 years) | 2% |
| Growth (6-15 years) | 22% |
| Mature (>15 years) | 76% |

*Chart: Donut*

**Interpretation:** Denver's data market is overwhelmingly mature, with 76% of jobs at companies over 15 years old - the highest mature company concentration among all US markets analyzed. This stands in stark contrast to San Francisco (39% mature) and even New York (52% mature). Only 2% of roles are at young startups under 5 years old, meaning early-stage opportunities are exceptionally rare. This maturity profile reflects the dominance of established enterprises like Oracle, Lockheed Martin, and Deloitte, and suggests that Denver is a market for building stable, long-term careers rather than riding startup growth curves.

## Ownership Type

**Based on ownership_type (206 jobs, 30% coverage)**

| Type | % of Roles |
|------|------------|
| Public | 17% |
| Private | 11% |
| Subsidiary | 2% |
| Acquired | 1% |

*Chart: Donut*

**Interpretation:** Public companies (17%) significantly outnumber private companies (11%) in Denver - the opposite pattern from San Francisco and New York where private companies dominate. This ownership distribution aligns with the mature company dominance and has significant implications for both job seekers and hiring managers. Candidates in Denver's market are likely to prioritize salary stability, benefits packages, and predictable compensation structures over equity upside. Companies offering significant equity as part of compensation may find this is less compelling to Denver candidates than it would be in coastal markets.

---

## Employer Size Distribution

**Based on employer_size (342 jobs, 51% coverage)**

| Size | % of Roles |
|------|------------|
| Enterprise (1,000+) | 34% |
| Scale-up (50-1,000) | 10% |
| Startup (<50) | 7% |

*Chart: Donut*

**Interpretation:** Enterprise companies dominate Denver's data market at 34% of total jobs - the highest enterprise concentration among all US markets analyzed. Scale-ups (10%) and startups (7%) combined account for only 17% of the market, meaning smaller company opportunities are genuinely limited. This enterprise dominance creates a market where candidates can expect structured hiring processes, defined job levels, comprehensive benefits, and established career ladders. For job seekers preferring the agility and ownership of smaller companies, Denver presents fewer options than coastal alternatives.

## Top Employers

| Rank | Employer |
|------|----------|
| 1 | Oracle |
| 2 | Deloitte |
| 3 | Outlier AI |
| 4 | SynergisticIT |
| 5 | Lockheed Martin |
| 6 | Launch Potato |
| 7 | Humana |
| 8 | Amazon |
| 9 | Google |
| 10 | Ibotta |

*Chart: Horizontal bar*

**Market interpretation:** Oracle's dominance (6% of the entire market) underscores Denver's position as a data infrastructure hub and makes it the single most important employer in the local data market. The presence of Deloitte reflects the professional services ecosystem that supports enterprise clients, while Lockheed Martin represents Colorado's significant aerospace and defense concentration. Big Tech names like Amazon and Google are present but do not dominate as they do in Seattle or the Bay Area. Notably, Ibotta represents the local success story - a Denver-founded fintech company that has grown to become a significant employer in the market.

## Role Specialization

| Subfamily | % of Roles |
|-----------|------------|
| Data Engineer | 21% |
| Data Analyst | 21% |
| ML Engineer | 20% |
| Data Scientist | 18% |
| Data Architect | 9% |
| Research Scientist (ML) | 5% |
| Product Analytics | 3% |
| Analytics Engineer | 2% |

*Chart: Horizontal bar*

**Interpretation:** Denver's role distribution is remarkably balanced across the four core data disciplines: Data Engineer (21%), Data Analyst (21%), ML Engineer (20%), and Data Scientist (18%). This equilibrium is unusual among major markets and contrasts sharply with San Francisco's ML-heavy distribution (38% ML Engineer). The balance suggests Denver's employers have mature, well-rounded data organizations rather than the research-focused ML teams common in Silicon Valley. Data Architect (9%) is notably elevated compared to other markets, reflecting the enterprise data infrastructure focus and the demand for professionals who can design large-scale data systems.

## Seniority Distribution

| Level | % of Roles |
|-------|------------|
| Senior | 38% |
| Mid-Level | 13% |
| Staff/Principal | 12% |
| Junior | 10% |
| Director+ | 6% |

*Chart: Horizontal bar*

**Senior-to-Junior Ratio: 6:1**

**Entry Accessibility Rate:** 23% of roles open to less than 3 years experience - the most accessible US market analyzed.

**Interpretation:** Denver's seniority distribution reveals its strength as an entry point for data careers. The 6:1 senior-to-junior ratio is dramatically more accessible than New York (10:1) or San Francisco (18:1), making Denver the best major US market for early-career professionals. Combined with the 13% mid-level representation, nearly a quarter of all roles are accessible to candidates with less than three years of experience. This accessibility likely reflects the mature enterprise base that maintains structured hiring pipelines including junior positions, rather than the senior-heavy hiring patterns of hypergrowth startups.

---

## IC vs Management Track

| Track | % of Roles |
|-------|------------|
| Individual Contributor | 88% |
| Management | 9% |

*Chart: Donut*

**Interpretation:** Denver's market is decisively IC-focused, with 88% of roles for individual contributors and only 9% in management. This pattern is consistent with other data markets and reflects the reality that data organizations require many more practitioners than managers. For professionals seeking management opportunities, the limited supply means competition will be intense, but the enterprise-heavy market does offer more structured paths to management than startup-dominated markets.

## Working Arrangement

**Two-layer analysis: job-level + employer defaults**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Job-level known | 22% |
| Fillable from employer defaults | 22% |
| **Effective known** | **43%** |

### Effective Arrangement Breakdown

| Arrangement | % of Roles |
|-------------|------------|
| Unknown | 57% |
| Onsite | 18% |
| Remote | 17% |
| Hybrid | 6% |
| Flexible | 4% |

*Chart: Donut*

**Interpretation:** Denver has the highest effective remote rate (17%) among all US markets analyzed, a distinction that aligns with Colorado leading the nation in remote work adoption (37% of the state workforce works remotely). What makes Denver unique is the near-parity between onsite (18%) and remote (17%) options - most markets show a clear preference for one or the other. This balance gives job seekers genuine flexibility in how they want to work. The hybrid category (6%) is relatively small, suggesting Denver employers tend toward clear policies rather than ambiguous "some days in office" arrangements.
