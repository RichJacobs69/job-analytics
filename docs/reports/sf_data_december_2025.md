# San Francisco Data & Analytics Market
## December 2025

---

## Key Findings

San Francisco continues to cement its position as the undisputed AI capital of the United States. The data reveals a market fundamentally transformed by machine learning and artificial intelligence, with nearly four in ten open roles seeking ML Engineers - a concentration nearly double that of New York City or Denver. This exceptional demand is driven by the city's unique cluster of autonomous vehicle companies (Waymo, Zoox), leading AI labs (OpenAI), and a dense ecosystem of AI-native startups funded by record venture capital flows into Bay Area AI companies.

The compensation landscape reflects this intense competition for ML talent. Research Scientists command a remarkable $250K median salary, while ML Engineers earn $188K at the median - a 6% premium over NYC and 19% over Denver. These figures underscore that for data professionals with strong ML capabilities, San Francisco remains the highest-paying market in the country. However, this specialization comes with trade-offs: traditional Data Analyst roles represent just 6% of the market compared to 17% in NYC, signaling that SF has evolved beyond general-purpose analytics toward deep technical ML work.

The market structure also reveals interesting dynamics around company maturity and ownership. Over half of all roles come from companies founded between 2010-2019 - the generation that includes Waymo, Roblox, Block, and Pinterest. These growth-stage companies offer a compelling combination of equity upside and operational stability that mid-career professionals find attractive. Meanwhile, the startup presence (24% of roles) is double that of NYC, reflecting the continued vitality of the Bay Area venture ecosystem.

- **AI epicenter:** AI/ML industry (15%) combined with Mobility (10%) means that autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence companies together account for a quarter of all industry-tagged roles - a uniquely San Francisco concentration that defines the market's character.
- **ML Engineer dominance:** Machine Learning Engineers represent 38% of all roles, nearly double the concentration seen in NYC (24%) and Denver (20%), reflecting the city's deep investment in AI-first companies.
- **Premium compensation:** Research Scientist ML roles command a $250K median salary while ML Engineers earn $188K at the median, establishing SF as the highest-paying market for ML practitioners.
- **Growth-stage market:** 51% of jobs come from companies 6-15 years old - the Waymo, Roblox, Block generation - offering equity upside with operational stability.
- **Extreme seniority skew:** The 18:1 senior-to-junior ratio is the highest among US markets, making SF one of the most challenging markets for early-career data professionals to break into.
