## 7. Company Age by HQ Location

| Company Age            | Local HQ Jobs | %     | Overseas HQ Jobs | %     |
|------------------------|---------------|-------|------------------|-------|
| 0-5 years (Young)      | 920           | 6.5%  | 371              | 8.1%  |
| 6-15 years (Growth)    | 4,794         | 33.8% | 1,408            | 30.6% |
| 16-30 years (Mature)   | 3,674         | 25.9% | 1,114            | 24.2% |
| 30+ years (Established)| 4,809         | 33.9% | 1,715            | 37.2% |

**Median company age:**

- This makes sense: older companies have had time to build global presence
- Young companies (<5 years) show slightly higher overseas HQ rate (8% vs 6.5%) - likely VC-backed startups expanding globally early

## Summary for Content

### The Key Narrative

**Where leadership sits matters** - and our data shows that varies dramatically by market:

1. **Geography matters**: Singapore candidates face 72% overseas HQ; UK 51%; US just 12%

2. **US dominates**: When the HQ is overseas, it is usually American. 70% of UK overseas-HQ jobs and 62% of Singapore come from US companies.

3. **Industry choice matters**: Want a local HQ? Look at Mobility (90%), Proptech (86%), or Healthcare (83%). Avoid Crypto (50%) or DevTools (64%).

4. **Size paradox**: Scaleups (200-1000 employees) are actually MORE locally focused than startups or enterprises.

5. **Age signals global reach**: Companies with overseas HQ are 5 years older on median - they have had time to expand internationally.
